## Load in manual synthesis dataframe


```{r networks}
networks_summary = googlesheets4::read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xjh_PTFbEathR8v5OOU9wY9yBw6C9JI7du6C0L4f_PM/edit?usp=sharing")
```

## Filter to filled out columns 

This was a manual synthesis, and as such has some gaps. In the process of filling these in based on the OG, non R friendly version and also from the network websites, but this is a work in progress. 

```{r full columns, echo=FALSE}
networks_summary_clean = networks_summary %>% select(Management.Structure, `CDEON Coordinated Distributed Experiments and Observations`, `EON Ecological Observatory Networks`, `LTMP Long-Term Monitoring Programs`, `LTRN Long-Term Research Networks`, `ORC Observational Research Consortia`, Coastal.Ecosystem)
```
